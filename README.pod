=head1 NAME

Tie::Hash::Blame - A hash that remembers where its keys were set

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Tie::Hash::Blame;

  my %hash;
  tie %hash, 'Tie::Hash::Blame';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Have you ever tried to track changes to a hash throughout a large program?
It's hard, isn't it?  This module makes things a little easier.  Its intended
use is for debugging, because ties are magic, and magic is evil.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 tied(%hash)->blame

Returns a hash reference containing the location of the last assignment to
each hash key.  The keys in the returned hash reference are the same as in the
underlying hash; the values, however, are all hash references with two keys:
'filename' and 'line_no'.
